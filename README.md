# Digital Communication Repository

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing three popular digital modulation schemes: QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), BASK (Binary Amplitude Shift Keying), and 16-QAM (16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). The purpose of this repository is to provide you with the tools and examples to understand and experiment with these modulation schemes in the context of digital communication systems.

## Introduction

Digital modulation is a fundamental concept in digital communication, where information is transmitted over a channel by varying one or more of the signal's characteristics, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase. This repository focuses on three widely used digital modulation techniques: QPSK, BASK, and 16-QAM.

### QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)

QPSK is a type of phase modulation scheme that uses four different phases to represent two bits of information. This modulation technique is known for its simplicity and efficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization.

The QPSK MATLAB code included in this repository allows you to generate QPSK-modulated signals and demodulate received signals, enabling you to simulate QPSK communication systems.

### BASK (Binary Amplitude Shift Keying)

BASK is a type of amplitude modulation scheme where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to represent digital data. In the case of BASK, two amplitudes are used to represent binary data, typically 0 and 1.

The BASK MATLAB code provided here allows you to generate BASK-modulated signals and demodulate received signals, giving you insights into BASK communication systems.

### 16-QAM (16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)

16-QAM is a more complex modulation scheme that uses both phase and amplitude variations to represent 4 bits of information. It is widely used in high-speed data communication systems.

The 16-QAM MATLAB code included in this repository allows you to generate 16-QAM-modulated signals and demodulate received signals, offering you a deeper understanding of 16-QAM communication systems.
